## 🚀 Getting Started

### 🤔 How it works?

First run data.py to all the datas. You don't have to physically write this data. You have to do it only one time.
After successfully getting all csv files (total 5 files), you can run main.py
main.py is the main py file. You can run as many time as you want :)
